# Smart-Alarm-Clock
CA2 of ECM1400 Programming

This program is a smart alarm clock intended to be run 24/7. It enables the user to schedule, edit and cancel alarms. The user is notified when an alarm is up via an alarm sound, text to speech and a notification which is displayed in the notifications column. The user is also notified when the weather in the location selected has changed and when there is a new news story. The web page will automatically refresh every 5 minutes to keep the notifications, weather and news up to date on screen.
